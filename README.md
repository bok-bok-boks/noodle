A lightweight Google frontend.

Supports normal search as well as image search.
Meant for devices that can't handle modern Google all that well.

There is no client-side JS. Populating results is handled by the server.

Planned features:
- [] Display webpages in a simpler style.
- [] Complete IE6 support.
